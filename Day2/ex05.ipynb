Observations in this dataset are limited to the United States waters of the Gulf of Mexico, collected during the SEAMAP Groundfish surveys from 1987 - 2010.  The dataset is compiled from observations obtained from two independent data sources.  Butch Pellegrin (NMFS) provided the data collected by NMFS and the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission (GSMFC) (dataset dated May 5, 2010) provided data from the state partners.  Data users should be aware that the datasets are constantly being re-examined and updated.  Therefore, analyses based on previous or subsequent versions of the data may yield different results.  This dataset was originally produced in order to build species distribution maps for the Gulf of Mexico in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill.
